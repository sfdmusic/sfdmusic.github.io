## Welcome to my GitHub Page!

My name is Andy and I have started this so I can run through some tutorials and learn things for leisure.  Heck, maybe some of it will be useful at work down the line!

I play guitar in a band called [Bowker](http://bowkerband.co.uk)
I have a small but perfectly formed record label called [Searching For Dandelions](http://searchingfordandelions.com)
I have started fooling around with Linux Mint as a dual boot on my ageing macbook pro and I dig Android, which is why I've ended up here!
