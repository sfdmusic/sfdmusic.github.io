## Welcome to my GitHub Page!

My name is Andy and I have started this so I can run through some tutorials and learn things for leisure.  Heck, maybe some of it will be useful at work down the line!

I play guitar in a band called [Bowker](http://bowkerband.co.uk)

I have a small but perfectly formed record label called [Searching For Dandelions](http://searchingfordandelions.com)

I have started fooling around with Linux Mint as a dual boot on my ageing macbook pro and I dig Android, which is why I've ended up here...

I work for [RoadRunner Legal](http://roadrunnerlegal.co.uk) as the office manager.  They do fixed fee HR for SMBs and numerous other legal tasks.

I'm trying to work out what the best CMS will be for another site I want to make and am leaning towards Grav as my other two sites are Wordpress and the work one is Joomla.  I'm not keen on Joomla as it's not very intuitive whereas Wordpress is as easy as you want it to be.

Anyway, enough of my yackin', let's see if this page updates when I click through on GitHub...
